To place your own logo on the sides of these printers, please follow the following instructions :
1. Open sides.png in Photoshop (found in materials/models/misfitworks/sides.png
2. Content-Aware the original design (Yes, it works flawlessly every time)
3. Place your own logos
4. Save as sides.png or whatever you want
5. Open it in vtfedit and save it as a vtf named sides.vtf, overwriting the original
6. Profit

![The Model](http://kyyye.uk/i/t8l10.png)

All credits to Misfit for creating the model and giving me permission to use it here!
It features a small indentation on the top to allow the 3d2d to look placed.
It is animated, meaning you can see the money moving inside, through the window


Thanks again, and enjoy!
